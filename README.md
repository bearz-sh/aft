# Aft

Aft aims to make it easier to setup docker environments, home lab or self host software with just vanilla docker.

Aft may grow into a docker compose package manager.

Aft uses handlebars and keepass to enable docker compose templates with the ability to dynamically generate secrets as
needed for services in docker compose files.

## Install
